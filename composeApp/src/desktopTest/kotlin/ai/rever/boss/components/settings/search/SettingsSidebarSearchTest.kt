/**
 * The rail's two modes.
 *
 * Layout-level rather than logic-level on purpose: whether typing actually swaps the section list
 * for a result list is a placement question, and placement questions pass every non-visual gate in
 * this repo before failing on screen.
 *
 * Assertions are `assertExists` rather than `assertIsDisplayed` for anything in a list. The rail is
 * a plain scrolling `Column`, so all 19 sections compose whether or not they fit the test window,
 * and pinning visibility would be pinning the harness's window height.
